# pyxaid-code
The main branch of the Pyxaid code

Due to the increased volume of technical questions about installing and using the 
Libra, Libra-X, Pyxaid and Pyxaid2 codes, I have decided to create a convenient public forum 
for all users with the intent:

a) to share my replies with not only a single user that have a trouble, but also other
potential users who may found that information useful;
b) so that the users/developers who have had some experience with the code would be able to share their
knowledge and skills with others;

Among different platforms I found that the Chemistry StackExchange is perhaps the best option.
https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/

So, since Aug. 27, 2017, please post you questions about Libra, Libra-X, Pyxaid, or Pyxaid2 there,
using the tags (#libra, #libra-x, #pyxaid, #pyxaid2) and perhaps some general tags like (#computational-chemistry).

This is only a test practice, I don't know how well it'll go, but lets try it. If you have ideas and suggestions for 
a better forum platform, please email me.
